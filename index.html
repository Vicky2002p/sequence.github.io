            The Jacks with TWO EYES are wild. To play a two-eyed Jack, place it
            on your discard pile and place one of your marker chips on any open
            space on the game board.
            <br />
            The Jacks with ONE EYE are anti-wild. To play a one-eyed Jack, place
            it on your discard pile and remove one marker chip from the game
            board belonging to your opponent. That completes your turn.
            <br />
            You cannot place one of your marker chips on that same space during
            this turn. You cannot remove a marker chip that is already part of a
            completed SEQUENCE. Once a SEQUENCE is achieved by a player or a
            team, it cannot be broken. You may play either one of the Jacks
            whenever they work best for your strategy, during your turn.
